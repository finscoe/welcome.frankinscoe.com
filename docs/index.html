    <h2>Welcome to My Capstone Portfolio</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Frank Inscoe, and after over a decade in higher education as a Spanish and English instructor, I began a new journey into the world of computer science. This capstone portfolio showcases my transition into technical roles focused on backend development, infrastructure engineering, and data-driven applications. It is the culmination of several years of study, self-teaching, and hands-on experimentation with systems like my self-hosted UNRAID-based server, <strong>HELIOS</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>The HELIOS Project</h2>
    <p>
      HELIOS is my custom-built home server environment designed to securely host file sharing, media streaming, subscription tracking, and more — all powered by Docker and managed via UNRAID. It runs over 20 Docker containers and stores more than 276 TB of data across 27 drives. The <a href="https://welcome.frankinscoe.com" target="_blank">landing page</a> and account request form allow users to gain secure access to services like Nextcloud, Plex, Jellyfin, Overseerr, and Wallos.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout the CS-499 course, I enhanced the HELIOS project in three ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Software Design & Engineering:</strong> Developed a modular Express.js backend and integrated service request form.</li>
      <li><strong>Algorithms & Data Structures:</strong> Created a priority queue in Python with SHA-256 deduplication for managing media requests.</li>
      <li><strong>Databases:</strong> Built an SQLite-backed logging system to persist and secure user-submitted requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Professional Goals</h2>
    <p>
      As I complete this program, I am proud to share that I’ve been accepted into SNHU’s Master’s program in Data Analytics. My long-term goal is to continue building secure, scalable systems that solve real-world problems — particularly in educational technology. This portfolio represents the skills I’ve acquired and applied, from system architecture and secure coding to technical writing and user-centered design.
