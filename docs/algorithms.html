    <h2>Artifact Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This enhancement showcases a queue-based request management system I developed for HELIOS using Python. The original approach processed media requests as individual, one-off entries with no validation, order control, or optimization. I refactored this to use a SHA-256 de-duplicating priority queue system to streamline and secure backend automation.
    </p>

    <h2>Motivation and Rationale</h2>
    <p>
      In the original implementation, HELIOS lacked a way to prevent duplicate or malformed requests. Users could submit redundant requests which were logged repeatedly. I saw an opportunity to apply algorithmic thinking to solve this through data structures. Designing a priority queue system that deduplicates and verifies input was the ideal solution.
    </p>

    <h2>Enhancements Implemented</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Implemented a Python queue structure using <code>collections.deque</code> and <code>hashlib</code> for request tracking</li>
      <li>Used SHA-256 hashes to identify and ignore duplicate submissions</li>
      <li>Designed custom enqueue and dequeue logic for ordered and validated processing</li>
      <li>Tested queue under concurrent load to verify runtime stability</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
    <p>
      One challenge was creating a hash function that would consistently identify duplicates without falsely rejecting valid requests. I overcame this by combining form fields into a consistent key string before hashing. Another issue was ensuring performance under simultaneous user input, which I tested by simulating multiple submissions using Python scripts.
    </p>

    <h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Algorithm design and validation</li>
      <li>Python data structures and hashing</li>
      <li>Queue-based logic for asynchronous processing</li>
      <li>Unit testing and runtime analysis</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructor Feedback Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Dr. Hawk highlighted the effectiveness of this enhancement in showing applied algorithmic thinking. They praised the thoughtful use of deduplication and the way I connected theory to a real-world media workflow. Their suggestion was to include more explanation on how hashing can prevent conflicts and the implications for data integrity.
    </p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      This enhancement deepened my appreciation for efficient algorithms in backend systems. It reminded me that thoughtful planning of data flow is essential to maintaining long-term system health. Integrating data structures like queues not only solved real pain points in HELIOS, but also reinforced my confidence in designing scalable logic from scratch.
