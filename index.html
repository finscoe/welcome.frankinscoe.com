      <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to my CS-499 Capstone Portfolio. I’m Frank Inscoe, and this site represents the culmination of my work and learning throughout the Computer Science program at SNHU. Over the course of this program, I’ve developed, tested, and refined my abilities in core areas of computer science, including software engineering, data structures and algorithms, and databases. This portfolio captures that growth and showcases my technical proficiency, problem-solving mindset, and dedication to producing secure and scalable solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this capstone experience, I’ve demonstrated the ability to design and evaluate computing solutions, apply iterative software development practices, and document my process clearly for both technical and non-technical audiences. The HELIOS media server project exemplifies how I’ve applied theoretical knowledge to solve real-world problems with practical and innovative solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        My professional self-assessment also reflects on essential soft skills, including collaboration, communication, and adaptability. Whether discussing system trade-offs or anticipating security vulnerabilities, I’ve worked to approach each enhancement with a mindset focused on quality, integrity, and long-term sustainability. As I transition into the next stage of my career in data analytics and software development, I’m confident that the skills showcased here will enable me to provide value in any technical environment.

      <h2>Portfolio Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This portfolio includes a selection of original and enhanced artifacts that demonstrate my competency across three critical categories:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Software Design & Engineering:</strong> The <a href="software.html">Software</a> page highlights enhancements made to the backend routing logic of my HELIOS Express server, emphasizing modularity, scalability, and middleware integration.</li>
        <li><strong>Algorithms & Data Structures:</strong> The <a href="algorithms.html">Algorithms</a> page demonstrates an optimized media request queue using Python’s `heapq`, emphasizing duplicate handling and request prioritization.</li>
        <li><strong>Databases:</strong> The <a href="databases.html">Databases</a> page showcases a robust logging mechanism added to track user media requests persistently via structured logging and rotating logs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each artifact is paired with a reflection narrative explaining the enhancement process, challenges overcome, lessons learned, and alignment with program outcomes. These enhancements collectively fulfill all course outcomes, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Employing collaborative and contextual code review strategies</li>
        <li>Communicating technical ideas clearly across written, oral, and visual forms</li>
        <li>Designing solutions based on efficient data structures and trade-off analysis</li>
        <li>Applying industry-standard practices and tools</li>
        <li>Addressing security vulnerabilities and integrating safeguards into design</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
